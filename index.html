		Hi! I’m Tonishka. My friends call me Toni.
		I'm a senior at NUS majoring in Computer Science and specializing in Artificial Intelligence; I'll be graduating
		in May 2024.
		I like building cool products. 
		In my free time, I like watching movies and TV shows. 
		I also like making things with my hands: so far I’ve made 6 coasters, a musical box, a crochet scarf, a tiny vase, 
		and . But my favorite pastime (and my very defining trait) is telling people my opinion on things that no one 
		should have an opinion on (ask me why I think croissants with coffee is a patently bad idea).
